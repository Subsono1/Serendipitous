Overview

## Serendipitous



## Project Description

The purpose of this website, is to help people find new alternatives to music and movies. There will be, two categories to choose from (Music, Movies) each one will be a separate button. Once the button is pressed it will create a random return of that specific button. It will show the item with all the information so people can open up to new alternatives and dig more into the returned information. 

## API and Data Sample

I will be using one API from Test dive (https://tastedive.com/read/api)- [API URL] (https://tastedive.com/api/similar)
```
 "Similar": {
        "Info": [
            {
                "Name": "!!!",
                "Type": "music"
            }
        ],
        "Results": [
            {
                "Name": "The Go! Team",
                "Type": "music"
            },
            {
                "Name": "Death From Above 1979",
                "Type": "music"
            },
            {
