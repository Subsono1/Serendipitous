Overview

## Randomize it!



## Project Description

The purpose of this website, is to help people find new alternatives to music and movies. There will be, two categories to choose from (Music, Movies) each one will be a separate button. Once the button is pressed it will create a random return of that specific button. It will show the item with all the information so people can open up to new alternatives and dig more into the returned information. 

## API and Data Sample

I will be using one API from Test dive (https://tastedive.com/read/api), [API URL] (https://tastedive.com/api/similar)
```
 "Similar": {
        "Info": [
            {
                "Name": "!!!",
                "Type": "music"
            }
        ],
        "Results": [
            {
                "Name": "The Go! Team",
                "Type": "music"
            },
            {
                "Name": "Death From Above 1979",
                "Type": "music"
            },
            {
                "Name": "Tv On The Radio",
                "Type": "music"
            },
            {
                "Name": "Menomena",
                "Type": "music"
            },
            {
                "Name": "Lcd Soundsystem",
                "Type": "music"
            },
            {
                "Name": "Hot Chip",
                "Type": "music"
            },
            {
                "Name": "Clap Your Hands Say Yeah",
                "Type": "music"
            },
            {
                "Name": "Vhs Or Beta",
                "Type": "music"
```

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
-will use an API to get data from a library of music and moves.
-will start by developing phone first
-clicking on the first button will create a random return of a song, clicking a second button will create a random return of a movie. will return image, information and links to resources. 
- a second page will add a general search for movies or songs with it's information.


#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Add second API
- Use local storage to save user favorites

## Priority Matrix

[Matrix] (https://www.meta-chart.com/share/matrix-priority)

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.
